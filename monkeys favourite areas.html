1. Tropical Rainforests
Tropical rainforests are perhaps the most iconic habitats for many monkey species. These dense, lush forests provide a rich variety of fruits, leaves, insects, and small animals that monkeys feed on. The thick canopy offers protection from predators and harsh weather. Notable species that live in rainforests include howler monkeys, spider monkeys, and capuchins.

2. Savannas
Savannas are open grasslands with scattered trees and shrubs. Some monkey species, such as baboons and vervet monkeys, are well adapted to these environments. Savannas provide a diverse diet including fruits, seeds, insects, and small animals. The open landscape allows for large social groups and the ability to spot predators from a distance.

3. Mountainous Regions
Certain monkey species thrive in mountainous areas, where the climate can be cooler and more variable. Japanese macaques, also known as snow monkeys, are famous for their ability to live in snowy mountain regions and even bathe in hot springs to stay warm. Mountainous habitats offer unique food sources and fewer predators compared to lowland areas.

4. Urban Areas
In various parts of the world, some monkeys have adapted to living in urban environments. These monkeys, such as rhesus macaques and vervet monkeys, often find food in human settlements, including crops, garbage, and handouts from people. While urban areas can provide abundant food, they also pose risks from traffic, pollution, and human conflict.

5. Mangroves and Coastal Areas
Mangrove forests and coastal areas are unique habitats where some monkeys, like the crab-eating macaques, are found. These environments offer a rich diet of fruits, insects, and aquatic organisms. The ability to swim and forage in water is an adaptation seen in these monkeys.

6. Deciduous and Mixed Forests
Deciduous forests, which shed their leaves seasonally, and mixed forests, which contain both deciduous and evergreen trees, provide diverse habitats for monkeys. Species such as colobus monkeys and langurs are often found in these environments. These forests offer seasonal food supplies and varying levels of canopy cover.

7. Dry Forests and Scrublands
Some monkeys live in drier habitats like scrublands and dry forests. These areas can be harsh with less predictable food and water sources. Species like the Patas monkey are adapted to these conditions, often traveling long distances to find food and water.

Adaptations to Habitats
Monkeys have developed a range of adaptations to thrive in their preferred habitats. These include:

Dietary Flexibility: Ability to eat a wide range of foods, from fruits and leaves to insects and small animals.
Social Structures: Forming complex social groups to help with protection and resource sharing.
Physical Adaptations: Traits like prehensile tails for arboreal species or strong limbs for terrestrial species.
