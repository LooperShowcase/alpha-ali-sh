        Monkeys are a diverse group of mammals belonging to the order Primates, which also includes apes and humans. They are generally characterized by their agile bodies, long tails (though some species are tailless), and dexterous hands with opposable thumbs. Here are some key points about monkeys:

        Diversity: There are over 260 species of monkeys, ranging in size from the tiny pygmy marmoset (about 4-6 inches) to the large mandrill (up to 3 feet).
        
        Habitats: Monkeys are found in various habitats such as rainforests, savannas, and mountains, primarily in Asia, Africa, and Central and South America.
        
        Social Behavior: Most monkeys are social animals and live in groups called troops. These groups can vary in size from a few individuals to several dozen.
        
        Diet: Their diet is generally omnivorous, consisting of fruits, leaves, insects, and occasionally small vertebrates.
        
        Intelligence: Monkeys are known for their intelligence and problem-solving abilities. They use tools, communicate through vocalizations and body language, and exhibit complex social behaviors.
        
        Classification: Monkeys are divided into two main groups: New World monkeys (from South and Central America) and Old World monkeys (from Africa and Asia). New World monkeys have prehensile tails, while Old World monkeys do not.
        
        Threats: Like many wildlife species, monkeys face threats from habitat loss due to human activities, hunting for bushmeat, and capture for the illegal pet trade.
        
        Conservation: Many species of monkeys are considered threatened or endangered. Conservation efforts focus on protecting their habitats and combating illegal wildlife trade.
        
        Overall, monkeys are fascinating creatures with a wide range of adaptations and behaviors that continue to intrigue researchers and wildlife enthusiasts alike.
